individual project mapping crime and foreclosures in LA


This repository contains the code and data to reproduce the reports “Crimes in LA County” and “Foreclosures in LA County.” The two reports were part of the individual portion of the final project for STAT506 Statistical Computing at UM-Ann Arbor. The project explores the geographic distribution of two social and economic problems in the LA area. 

The reports show that areas that report high crime are also report high rates of foreclosures. This result is expected considering that social problems are often related and afflict similar communities. For both crime and foreclosures, the rates were highest around the central part of the county and less in the outskirts. 

The project used data on crime from LAPD and from the ACS. More details are provided in the papers. 

The project covers the theoretical concepts and applications of the following topics:

-	Summary statistics using dplyr
-	Ggplot
-	Ggmap
-	Shapefiles for GIS
